## ðŸŽ“ Learning Gatsby

If you're looking for more guidance on plugins, how they work, or what their role is in the Gatsby ecosystem, check out some of these resources:

- The [Creating Plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/creating-plugins/) section of the docs has information on authoring and maintaining plugins yourself.
- The conceptual guide on [Plugins, Themes, and Starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/plugins-themes-and-starters/) compares and contrasts plugins with other pieces of the Gatsby ecosystem. It can also help you [decide what to choose between a plugin, starter, or theme](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/plugins-themes-and-starters/#deciding-which-to-use).
- The [Gatsby plugin library](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/) has over 1750 official as well as community developed plugins that can get you up and running faster and borrow ideas from.
